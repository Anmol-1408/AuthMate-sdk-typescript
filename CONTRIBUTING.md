## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add proper type definitions for all functions and interfaces
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Remove trailing whitespace

### Example Code Style

```typescript
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password
 * @param credentials - User login credentials
 * @returns Promise resolving to authentication response
 */
export async function authenticateUser(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResponse> {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/auth/login', credentials);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new AuthMateError('Authentication failed', error);
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all existing tests pass
